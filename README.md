# Global GDP and Internet Usage Visualization

An interactive data visualization tool that explores how GDP and internet usage have evolved across countries from 2000 to 2020. This project helps users analyze global development trends using dynamic charts and a world map interface.

## ðŸ“¦ Description
This tool was designed to bridge the gap between economic and digital development. Users can explore data in various formatsâ€”such as line charts, slope graphs, and a choropleth mapâ€”making it easy to spot correlations, trends, and outliers.

Built with D3.js and vanilla JavaScript, the visualization offers an engaging experience for both technical and non-technical users. Whether you're comparing internet adoption across regions or analyzing GDP growth over time, this tool provides clear, interactive insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Visual Studio Code with the "Live Server" extension installed

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the "Live Server" extension if you haven't already:
   - Click on the Extensions icon in VS Code (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server"
   - Click "Install" on the extension by Ritwick Dey

### Running the Application
1. Open `index.html` in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
3. The visualization will open in your default web browser

### Alternative: Using Python's Built-in Server
If you prefer not to use VS Code's Live Server, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

Note: If port 8000 is already in use, you can specify a different port number:
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

## Using the Visualization

   - Input specific years using the number inputs
   - The visualization will update to show data for the selected range

3. **Visualization Types**
   - **Line Chart**: Shows trends over time for selected countries
   - **Slope Chart**: Compares start and end values for the selected period
   - **Stream Graph**: Shows relative proportions of selected countries
   - **Bar Chart**: Compares end-year values across selected countries

4. **Metric Toggle**
   - Switch between GDP and Internet usage data within the modal
   - The main map will update to match the selected metric
